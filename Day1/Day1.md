ðŸš€ Day 1 of Learning Utsav
ðŸŒŸ Key Learnings
On Day 1, I began exploring the foundational concepts of APIs and the client-server architecture, which are essential for backend development with Node.js. I also learned about the key HTTP methods that allow communication between a client (like a browser) and a server.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
API (Application Programming Interface)

APIs allow two applications or systems to communicate with each other.
They act as a middleman between the client (frontend) and server (backend) by exchanging data.
Example: When you log in to a website, the browser sends a POST request to the server with your credentials. If correct, the API returns a response indicating success.

Client-Server Architecture

This architecture defines how a client sends requests and receives responses from a server.
The client can be a browser, Postman, or any frontend tool, while the server handles the business logic and data processing.


HTTP Methods â€“ These are used to interact with a serverâ€™s resources:

GET: Retrieve data from the server(fetching user details).
POST: Send new data to the server (creating a new user).
PUT / PATCH: Update existing data ( modifying user info).
DELETE: Remove data (deleting a user profile).


HTTP Status Codes â€“ Indicate the result of a request:

200 OK: Request was successful.
201 Created: A resource was successfully created.
400 Bad Request: The server couldnâ€™t understand the request due to invalid input.
404 Not Found: The requested resource doesnâ€™t exist.
500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating a server issue.


Node.js & its  Features:
-Non-blocking I/O and asynchronous event-driven architecture.
- Highly scalable for real-time applications.
- Single-threaded but efficiently handles multiple connections.
